# Python 

## Data Types

**Integers** are whole numbers. For example:

* `2`
* `-3`
* `0`

**Floats** are numbers with a decimal point. For example: 

* `1.2`
* `-3.0`
* `26/3` (evaluates to `8.666`)

**Strings** are characters enclosed by single `'` or double `"` quotation marks. Any text enclosed by quotes will be treated as a string.

* `"My Grandpa's deck has no pathetic cards"`
* `'85.3'`

Note the second example â€“ `85.3` is a float; `'85.3'` is a string.

**Booleans** have two possible values: `True` and `False`. These can also be expressed as `1` (true) or `0` (false).

We can use the [`type()` function](#functions) to figure out the data type of an object.

## Variables

Variables are assigned using the `=` sign:

```
variable_name = value
```

For example:

* `composer = "buxtehude"`
* `year = 1637`

The variable name can be almost anything. Here are some general rules to consider when naming a variable:

* The name must start with a letter or underscore
* The name can only consist of letters, numbers, or underscores
* Variables are case sensitive (i.e. Python interprets `my_number`, `MY_NUMBER`, and `My_Number` as different variables)
* Python has a set of "reserved words" that cannot be used as variable names. These are words that already have a set meaning in Python, such as `True`, `False`, `for`, and `if`. A full list can be found [**here**](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/keywords-identifier).
